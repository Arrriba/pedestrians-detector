\section{What? Why? How?}
\label{section:what}


There are a lot of people out there dreaming about how the future will look like, and there is a very common answer to this question: self-driving cars. Currently, the automotive industry is trying to step out of the ordinary and offer an autonomous experience to the driver. A car is equipped with lots of sensors, just like humans - it can see things, or react to them. The idea is to teach the car to make decisions based on what these sensors intercept. This paper is trying to focus on one of the many branches of autonomous driving: endowing the car with the ability of seeing.
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the (scientific) problem? 
	
	An autonomous car should be able to "see" and make its own decisions based on the input. This paper aims to provide a fast and reliable computer vision solution for pedestrians detection, which is one of the most crucial aspects when it comes to self-driving cars. Using the input from the camera, any pedestrian should be detected in less than the blink of an eye, and from a considerable distance, so that the moving car gets the possibility to react smoothly.
	\item Why is it important? 
	
	The goal is to get to a higher level of autonomy, but the hardest thing to do is keeping humans as safe as possible. The number of car crashes is huge every year, mostly because of lack of attention or driver's drowsiness. A machine will never get tired and this is why the automotive industry is trying to design the car to take over most of the driver's responsibilities. The thing here is that when it comes to human safety, the machine is not allowed to make mistakes, so the purpose is first of all to make these detection algorithms reach perfection.
	  
	\item What is your basic approach? 
	
	The idea is to create an intelligent algorithm that gets an image as input and outputs it with an emphasis on where the pedestrian has been detected. The algorithm should be able to provide really fast and accurate responses, therefore transfer learning techniques will also be used.  
\end{itemize}



\section{Paper structure and original contribution(s)}
\label{section:structure}

The research presented in this paper is focused on outlining the theory behind the TinyYoloV3 model and employing it for the particular problem of pedestrian detection in different contexts.

The main contribution of this report is to present a solution based on an intelligent classifier consisting of a pre-trained model which is run against multiple sets of data in the aim of solving the problem of pedestrian, vehicle and road sign detection.

The second contribution of this report is the development of a simple and intuitive mobile application that will present a practical user interface through which the user can easily test the algorithm results on input of their own.

The third contribution of this thesis consists of the employment of a number of optimizations with a view to increasing the overall accuracy of the algorithm and testing its performance in different scenarios.

The work is structured in seven chapters as follows: 

The first chapter is a short introduction in the subject of object detection in the driving assistance field, what it is about and why it is important and our reasons that were behind choosing this topic. 

The second chapter describes the scientific problem in more detai and considers the advantages and disadvantages of our aproachl.

The third chapter treats some other related work in the field and gives a brief description of their results.

In chapter four we provide the investigate approach, togheter with the tools and technologies that were used in order to implement it. We describe the underlying architecture of the TinyYoloV3 model and the algorithm employed by it, stating how we will use this for our problem and how it is suited for the driving assistance object of study. We show how the algorithm works in practice and provide a short list of the tools we will be using for our study.

Chapter five comprises the main part of this report and consists of the description of our application requirements, the methodology by which we plan to solve the problem, the datasets we will be conducting our experiments on and the results obtained in the end. At the end of the chapter, we also provide some discussion around the results and potential optimizations to the algorithm, comparing the results obtained with the initial ones. The chapter ends with a small presentation of the user interface.

Chapter 6 explains the experimental methodology and the numerical results obtained with our approach and the state of the art approaches. Our focus in this chapter is on the interpretation and the statistical validation of the results. Also, this chapter is a dive into the philosophical aspects of autonomous driving and how this is likely to affect the way in which we report ourselves to the task of driving in general. We analyze the objectivity of the solution proposed and raise some interesting questions relating to the ethics of the smart driving assistants in general. We also provide some interesting data about the way our algorithm performs on individuals of different races and ethnicities, by this trying to advance the idea of diversity and inclusion in the way we use such technology.

The last chapter offers a summarization of our conclusions and future work and also try to analyze the strenghts and weaknesses of our application with the focus on what we can improve both in the algorithm and the application.



\chapter{Scientific Problem}
\label{section:scientificProblem}


\section{Problem definition}
\label{section:problemDefinition}

Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are groups of electronic technologies that assist drivers in driving and parking functions. Through a safe human-machine interface, ADAS increase car and road safety. ADAS use automated technology, such as sensors and cameras, to detect nearby obstacles or driver errors, and respond accordingly.

As most road accidents occur due to human error, ADAS are developed to automate, adapt, and enhance vehicle technology for safety and better driving. ADAS are proven to reduce road fatalities by minimizing human error. Safety features are designed to avoid accidents and collisions by offering technologies that alert the driver to problems, implementing safeguards, and taking control of the vehicle if necessary. Adaptive features may automate lighting, provide adaptive cruise control, assist in avoiding collisions, incorporate satellite navigation and traffic warnings, alert drivers to possible obstacles, assist in lane departure and lane centering, provide navigational assistance through smartphones, and provide other features.

The point of this paper is to show a implies of identifying people on foot in any kind of conditions and tie this to the current climate state to propose to the client the foremost suitable activities to be taken in certain activity circumstances or to respond naturally to them.

The main advantage of an artificial intelligent algorithm is its ability to analyse and employ an enormous quantity of data, much more efficiently than possible for humans through classical statistical analyses. Moreover, the more data received, the more accurate the result will be.

The personal driving assistant would be built off an intelligent classification algorithm based on neural networks. Other methods used for obstacle detection include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item template matching approach - the real image is compared against a sufficient number of templates of the object-of-interest to identify the presence of the object in the sample image.
\end{itemize}

We will be using the Deep Learning approach. Our classifier will receive as input the image or video sequence and output the same image, with the obstacles marked and delimited accordingly. This should provide a good start for further improvements and additional features that would contribute to a better navigation experience in autonomous driving.

On the other hand, processing image with people is a challenge even for an intelligent algorithm. Most of the images may be difficult to read an interpret, which means that large sets of data with labeled images are required for the algorithm to work properly. Machines are still having a hard time understanding images with people and using certain unclear images can be misleading for the AI, that can provide erroneous or implausible detections.

\section{Challenges}

Much of effort was concentrated on trying to make the algorithm run faster and get a better accuracy with the amount of resources that we have had at our disposal. In trying to work with a model that is pre-trained, we have had little control over the time it takes the algorithm to do a detection. The models themselves are pretty large in size and take up a great deal of resources to run. 

Lack of sufficient resources to run the algorithm was an imminent problem that we have come across.

\chapter{Investigated approach}
\label{chapter:proposedApproach}
\section{Motivation}
\label{section:motivation}

There are a lot of documented ways of implementing object detection nowadays, and most of them are written in Python. Why is this the most popular language for AI and ML based projects? Because it offers a great library ecosystem. Libraries provide base level items so developers don't have to code them from the beginning every time.
(https://djangostars.com/blog/why-python-is-good-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/)

TensorFlow is a free and open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It uses Python to provide a convenient front-end API for building applications, while executing those applications in high-performance C++. This is the core library that is used in this project, with a twist that will be revealed in the second experiment.

\section{First Experiment}
\label{section:firstExperiment}

We first started by implementing a mobile application with a regular client-server model. The server was written in Python with a Flask RESTful API. The client side is implemented in React Native and has to send the photo to the server and then wait for the detection. 

TODO

\section{Second Experiment}
\label{section:secondExperiment}

As fast detection is a vital aspect in automotive, and since we are driving towards a real-time experience, an almost instant response would be desirable. 

Reducing the response time as much as
possible is the main reason for switching to another perspective: TensorFlow for JavaScript. It is designed as a breakthrough for running entirely client-sided machine learning models. And it is exactly what we needed to get rid of the client-server communication overhead, bringing us a few steps closer to real-time detection.

TensorFlow.js offers a set of pre-trained models that have been ported from the "pythonic" version of Tensorflow Object Detection API - an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models. We will be using the object detection model: COCO-SSD. 

https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object\textunderscore detection/README.md


\subsection{The Model - overview}
\label{section:theModelOverview}

COCO-SSD is an object detection model that aims to localize and identify multiple objects in a single image. This model detects objects defined in the COCO dataset, which is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. More detailed information about the data can be found in Chapter 5, the Data section. 

https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd

SSD stands for Single Shot MultiBox Detection, as the model is capable of detecting 80 classes of objects (from person, vehicles, traffic light, stop signs to elephants and bananas). It can take as input any browser-based image elements (<img>, <video>, <canvas> elements, for example), returning an array of bounding boxes with class name and confidence level. SSD is a neural network architecture made of a single feed-forward convolutional neural network that predicts the image's objects labels and their position during the same action. The counterpart of this "single-shot" characteristic is an architecture that uses a "proposal generator," a component whose purpose is to search for regions of interest within an image.

Once the regions of interests have been identified, the second step is to extract the visual features of these regions and determine which objects are present in them, a process known as "feature extraction." COCO-SSD default's feature extractor is lite\textunderscore mobilenet\textunderscore v2, an extractor based on the MobileNet architecture. In general, MobileNet is designed for low resources devices, such as mobile, single-board computers, e.g., Raspberry Pi, and even drones.

\subsection{Mobile Integration}
\label{section:mobileIntegration}

The React Native mobile app has to be created with Expo because the React Native CLI method raises a lot of compatibility issues and version constraints between TensorFlow.js and other packages. Moreover, the linking has to be done manually without Expo, which can lead to more complicated environmental errors. 


After setting up the Expo project so that it has TensorFlow.js properly installed, the model can be "installed" to the mobile app by running the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    $ npm install @tensorflow-models/coco-ssd
\end{lstlisting}
There are three main steps for making a prediction:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{import} model
  \begin{lstlisting}
    import * as cocossd from "@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd";
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item \textbf{load} model
  \begin{lstlisting}
    const model = await cocossd.load();
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item \textbf{detect} image
  \begin{lstlisting}
    const predictions = await model.detect(img);
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
At \textbf{load}, the developer is able to specify certain configurations for the model. The documentation provides the following ModelConfig interface: 
    \begin{lstlisting}
    export interface ModelConfig {
      base?: ObjectDetectionBaseModel;
      modelUrl?: string;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
The \textbf{base} attribute controls the base CNN model, which can be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 'mobilenet\textunderscore v1' 
  \item 'mobilenet\textunderscore v2' - has the highest classification accuracy
  \item 'lite\textunderscore mobilenet\textunderscore v1' - \textit{default}, is the smallest in size and the fastest in inference speed. Since we are keen on achieving the fastest possible results, we will be using this as the base model.
\end{itemize}

For the \textbf{detection} part, we are passing as a parameter the image converted to a Tensor. A Tensor is a container which can hold data in multiple dimensions. This method can also receive the image in different shapes, such as html elements: ImageData, HTMLImageElement, HTMLCanvasElement, HTMLVideoElement. It provides two more optional parameters: maxNumBoxes and minScore. Thus, the \textbf{detect} function can have the following arguments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{img}: either Tensor or html element to perform the detection on.
  \item \textbf{maxNumBoxes}: the maximum number of bounding boxes of detected objects. There can be multiple detections of the same class, but at different locations. Default: 20.
  \item \textbf{minScore}: The minimum level of confidence for returning detections. It can be a value between 0 and 1, default: 0.5. 
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{output} is an array of objects. An object contains the bounding box parameters, the class and the score: 

\begin{lstlisting}
    [{
      bbox: [x, y, width, height],
      class: "person",
      score: 0.8380282521247864
    }, {
      bbox: [x, y, width, height],
      class: "kite",
      score: 0.74644153267145157
    }]
\end{lstlisting}
